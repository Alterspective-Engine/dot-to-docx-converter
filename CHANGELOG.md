## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-18

### Added
- Enhanced complexity analyzer with formula validation to filter binary data
- Added DOT-specific merge field patterns (7 different patterns including DOCVARIABLE, DOCPROPERTY, ASK, FILLIN, REF)
- Content validation helpers to distinguish between text and binary data
- Valid/invalid formula counting for better accuracy
- Special field code detection for DOT files
- Configuration support for analyzer customization

### Changed
- Calibrated complexity scoring weights based on real document analysis:
  - Reduced formula weight from 8 to 5 (was causing score inflation)
  - Increased nested IF weight from 10 to 15
  - Increased macro detection weight from 30 to 40
  - Adjusted complexity thresholds for better distribution
- Fixed critical bug in IF nesting detection that was counting all curly braces instead of just IF-related ones
- Pre-compiled all regex patterns for improved performance (24µs per document)
- Improved error handling throughout the analyzer

### Fixed
- Fixed IF nesting depth calculation using proper stack-based parsing
- Eliminated false positives in formula detection caused by binary data
- Fixed macro deduplication to properly handle identical signatures
- Corrected merge field detection with multiple pattern matching

### Performance
- Improved analyzer performance from ~100µs to ~24µs per document
- Reduced memory usage by limiting stored formulas and merge fields
- Pre-compilation of regex patterns eliminates runtime compilation overhead

### Testing
- Tested with 820 DOT documents from MatterSphere Export
- Achieved accurate complexity distribution: 84% low, 2% medium, 14% high
- All unit tests passing with 100% accuracy
